Groundwire is the segment of urbit address space registered and owned on the Bitcoin blockchain as ordinal / inscription based Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Groundwire identities can be independently generated by TK [However this works], and use L1 Bitcoin fees as their method of spam resistance, in contrast to Azimuth's 'premined' ownership and finite address space.
